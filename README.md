### About
The idea of this project came out when I realized that I could automate the things in the WhatsApp group of my school. Everytime there's a new assignment in Google Classroom, the teacher posts it in the group. So I decided to make a bot and make things easier.

### How to use
Currently, the bot it's still private. I'm focusing to make it functional to my school, but I plan on making it public later.

### Technologies
Node.js, Firebase (database) and Classroom API.
